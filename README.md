Original text and translation by Brahim Zellal, I've updated the kabyle text according to the latest transcription standard (work under progress). The PWA offers multiple transliterations of the Kabyle text: in addtion to the original Latin text, you can select several other scripts: Tifinagh, Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, Syriac, Musnad, Phoenician and Aramaic.
