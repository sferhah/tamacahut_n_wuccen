Original text and translation (French) by Brahim Zellal, I've updated the Kabyle text according to the latest transcription standard (work under progress). The PWA offers multiple transliterations of the Kabyle text: in addition to the original Latin text, you can select several other scripts: Tifinagh, Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, Syriac, Musnad, Phoenician and Aramaic.
