Original text and translation (French) by Brahim ZELLAL, I've updated the Kabyle text according to the latest transcription standard[^3]. The PWA offers multiple transliterations of the Kabyle text: in addition to the original Latin text, several other scripts are available[^4]: Tifinagh, Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, Syriac, Musnad, Phoenician and Aramaic.

[^3]: I did not have access to the 1962 edition, but to the reissued version of Tassadit YACINE (1999). Examples: • aț-țneṭleḍ (Tassadit Yacine) → ad tneṭleḍ • ț-țameqwrant (ț-țameqʷrant) → d tameqrant • a k-ččeɣ → ad k-ččeɣ • awal n-wuccen → awal n wuccen • tebbwi → tewwi. Sometimes I've taken the liberty to change some weird notations such as: • tiɣeggʷa → tiɣugga • yettembiẓẓiḍ → yettmiẓẓid.
[^4]: With the exception of Tifinagh, script mappings are arbitrary and unstandardized.
