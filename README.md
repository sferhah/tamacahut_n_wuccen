Original text and translation (French) by Brahim Zellal, I've updated the Kabyle text according to the latest transcription standard[^1]. The PWA offers multiple transliterations of the Kabyle text: in addition to the original Latin text, several other scripts are available[^2]: Tifinagh, Arabic, Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, Syriac, Musnad, Phoenician and Aramaic.

[^1]: Work under progress.
[^2]: With the exception of Tifinagh, script mappings are arbitrary and unofficial.
